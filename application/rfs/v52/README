The main files are

rfs
rfs_c

These files contain global stability analysis of symmetric unimodal
limit cycles of relay feedback systems.  The first one is related with
the more conservative condition, but, on the other hand, more
efficient.  Although more conservative, this condition was enough to
prove stability of most systems analyzed, including the examples in the
paper (all, but the last one).  The second file uses the conic
relations explained in the paper.  IT is less conservative, but less
efficient.
